#### Use instructions:
Swift version used is 3.0-dev. Make sure you have a compatible version. 

Clone the repository. Go to directory of any single exercise on Bash (for example `1_1_HelloWorld`), run `swift build` and then `.build/debug/<ExerciseName>` (for example `.build/debug/HelloWorld`) and watch the magic happen (though it might not be the most complex magic).
